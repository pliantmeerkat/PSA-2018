PSA-2018

This Repo contains all files required to compile and run my application - PSA-2018, however, the bulk of the programs code will be contained in the src/psa/PKG.2018 folder/path. in addition to this additional files are/will be found in other locations, eg Modes folder. these additional files must be written and edited in the provided manner.

What is PSA? In short PSA is simply a method of creating musical structures algorithmically using Musical theory. I intend to create a framework whereby in addition to the core methods and classes provided, other user created techniques may be added, allopwing for extensive customisation and originality of created content.

Whats been done so far? Very Little, this program is extremely early in development so almost everything is still yet to be started

What needs to be done?

    basic application framework, core functions and classes etc
    file i/o (mode file reading etc)
    GUI
    much much more....

this is a total wip so any feedback or suggestions are most welcome, i would also very much appreciate any technical feedback, im still a total amateur at this so i will try to take any suggestions on board!
