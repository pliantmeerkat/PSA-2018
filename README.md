## PSA-2018

This Repo contains all files required to compile and run my application - PSA-2018, however, the bulk of the programs code will be contained in the src/psa/PKG.2018 folder/path. in addition to this additional files are/will be found in other locations, eg Modes folder. these additional files must be written and edited in the provided manner.

# What is PSA?
In short PSA is simply a method of creating musical structures algorithmically using Musical theory. I intend to create a framework whereby in addition to the core methods and classes provided, other user created techniques may be added, allopwing for extensive customisation and originality of created content. 

# The vision

My 15+ years of musical tuition and 5 years of academic study has shown me that in order to become capable of composing effective compositions extensive knowledge is required. I strongly believe that this was only possible for me due to a culture of musical tuiition within my family, and the nescessary funds required in order to achieve this. Knowing this I am committed to make music more approachable, there are countless extremely talented musicisans out there who likely have not been afforded the same oppertunities as myself, and I wish to create an environment where any such individual is able to create compositions to their fullest potential. In addition to this I intend PSA to be educational, with clear musical documentation describing the many techniques used in composition. I wish for a program that is able to work with the composer, tailoring to their specific musical styles and creating truly unique compositions.

# Whats been done so far?
Very Little, this program is extremely early in development so almost everything is still yet to be started

# What needs to be done?
 - basic application framework, core functions and classes etc
 - file i/o (mode file reading etc)
 - GUI
 - much much more....
 
this is a total wip so any feedback or suggestions are most welcome, i would also very much appreciate any technical feedback, im still a total amateur at this so i will try to take any suggestions on board!
